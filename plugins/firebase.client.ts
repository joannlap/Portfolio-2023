Every summer, Foundation Hiphop Academy organizes a 3-week intensive bootcamp that allows dancers to immerse themselves in the elements of street and club culture. The bootcamp offers over 60 workshops in various street styles, as well as lectures, parties and an evaluation program known as the Hawks Method. \n\n The visual language of Foundation Bootcamp is influenced by street and pop art. My inspiration for the design came from hiphop and street magazines, graffiti art, and movie posters. The overall approach aimed to capture the essence of a cityscape, combining elements like an assembly of Avengers.",
