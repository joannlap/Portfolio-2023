The bootcamp offers over 60 workshops in various street styles, as well as lectures, parties and an evaluation program known as the Hawks Method. \n\n The visual language of Foundation Bootcamp is influenced by street and pop art. My inspiration for the design came from hiphop and street magazines, graffiti art, and movie posters.
