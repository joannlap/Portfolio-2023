    <p>
      I'm Jo-Ann, a graphic designer who focuses on 3D modelling, motion design,
      and illustration. I strongly believe that visual language can bridge
      communication gaps among people of different cultures and backgrounds.
      With a bachelors degree in interaction design, I have paved my way
      developing a strong interest in graphic design and craftsmanship. Next to
      design my passion for dance has grown over the past couple years that it
      has taken it’s own journey and career path.<br />
